# Flathead - a Haskell ZMachine
A Haskell implementation of [Eric Lippert's](http://ericlippert.com/) OCaml ZMachine. Eric's series starts here: [West of House](http://ericlippert.com/2016/02/01/west-of-house/). You can find Eric's implementation [here](https://github.com/ericlippert/flathead).

The branches will be in sync with Eric's, that should make following both projects easier. I wont' have time to blog about it as I go along so I'll explain any significant decisiones I may take here.

Code of this branch follows part seven and eight of Eric's bloq series:

[Living room](http://ericlippert.com/2016/02/15/living-room/)

[Attic](http://ericlippert.com/2016/02/17/attic/)

We get to begin learning how strings are compressed in a .z3 file and how we can decode them, allthough things are more complicated than what may appear in these last two episodes.
