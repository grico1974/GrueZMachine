# Flathead - a Haskell ZMachine
A Haskell implementation of [Eric Lippert's](http://ericlippert.com/) OCaml ZMachine. Eric's series starts here: [West of House](http://ericlippert.com/2016/02/01/west-of-house/). You can find Eric's implementation [here](https://github.com/ericlippert/flathead).

The branches will be in sync with Eric's, that should make following both projects easier. I wont' have time to blog about it as I go along so I'll explain any significant decisiones I may take here.
