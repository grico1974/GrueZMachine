# Flathead - a Haskell ZMachine
A Haskell implementation of [Eric Lippert's](http://ericlippert.com/) OCaml ZMachine. Eric's series starts here: [West of House](http://ericlippert.com/2016/02/01/west-of-house/). You can find Eric's implementation [here](https://github.com/ericlippert/flathead).

The branches will be in sync with Eric's, that should make following both projects easier. I wont' have time to blog about it as I go along so I'll explain any significant decisiones I may take here.

Ok let's get started. This branch will cover Eric's first 3 blogs in the series:

[West of house](http://ericlippert.com/2016/02/01/west-of-house/)

[North of house](http://ericlippert.com/2016/02/03/north-of-house/)

[Forest path](http://ericlippert.com/2016/02/05/forest_path/)
	
Worth noting that allthough Eric keeps his code as clean as possible with very little explicit typing, I wont do the same with Haskell. I am relatively new to the language so explicitly typing is a safety net for me at this moment. Haskell's typing is not very intrusive to begin with so it will be perfectly fine.
