# Flathead - a Haskell ZMachine
A Haskell implementation of [Eric Lippert's](http://ericlippert.com/) OCaml ZMachine. Eric's series starts here: [West of House](http://ericlippert.com/2016/02/01/west-of-house/). You can find Eric's implementation [here](https://github.com/ericlippert/flathead).

The branches will be in sync with Eric's, that should make following both projects easier. I wont' have time to blog about it as I go along so I'll explain any significant decisiones I may take here.

To build the project I'll be using the windows and mac Haskell platform. You can download it at [Haskell Language](https://www.haskell.org/)

Disclaimer: I've started this project to begin learning Haskell. I am in no way experienced with the language nor with OCaml so this will be a pure learning experiencein the functional world. I'd appreciate any lost soul who happens to stumble upon this project and knows about Haskell to give any constructive feedback about how well or awefully bad I'm porting Eric's code.
